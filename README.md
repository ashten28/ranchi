# Ranchi

`Lunch` translates to `Ranchi` in Japanese

## What to eat for lunch?
I live in Malaysia where the variety of food is of abundance. 
However, ask any Malaysian, they will tell you they face a similar daily question to answer which is "WHAT TO EAT FOR LUNCH?!". 

## How does Ranchi help?
To answer this 'massive' question, I decided to build a simple shiny app that makes suggestion on where we should eat. 
The goal is for Ranchi to suggest places based on your location but for now it is just for Midvalley (I work here haha).

## What data does Ranchi use?
I have collected data based on our historical visits of restaurants in Midvalley by my colleagues and I. 
Data is stored in a Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NgSBO6L0MkMbioPnE2F4sJaXUVd-aN2HMKWEfRc5OSU/edit#gid=0). Google Sheets makes it easy to enter data and allow shiny apps to automatically pick it updates. 

## What will Ranchi be able to do?
- Random suggest restaurants
- Smart suggest restaurants (using ML to suggest restaurants based on past visits)
- Suggestions beyond restaurants (e.g: bars, coffee places)

## Ranchi's development?
Since this is a hobby project, progress has been slow. Next step to work on is the smart suggestion
